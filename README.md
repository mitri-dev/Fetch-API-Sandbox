## Fetch API Sandbox!  
This is a small project where I used the **fetch API** in different ways.  
  - Used the **GET** method to extract the data from a **txt** file.    
  - Used the **GET** method to extract the data from a **JSON** file and created a list.  
  - Used the **GET** method to fetch data from an **API**, in this case the typicode's posts API, and created a list.  
  - Used the **POST** method to send the data of the **input values** to the API.  
    -  Page will show a message corresponding to the POST **status code**. *new*  

Made with **Vanilla JavaScript** and used *Async/Await* to handle promises.
